My dot files

Run init.sh to create symlinks and initialize sub modules
```
$ ./init.sh
```

Currently preferred shell is zsh. So change default shell to zsh by running this after first login:
```
$ chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Change terminal to use solarized theme and background colour.


For Mac iterm2:
